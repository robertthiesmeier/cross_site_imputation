# Cross-site imputation to recover covariates without sharing individual-level pooled data
On this site, we illustrate computer code to apply cross-site imputation. A preprint is available [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.19.24319364v1.full.pdf). :page_facing_up:. All datasets are simulated, and you can try out the code and implementation of the software package yourself.

## What is the context? 
Missing data is a common challenge across scientific disciplines. Current imputation methods require the availability of individual data to impute missing values. Often, however, missingness requires using external data for the imputation. Therefore, propose a new imputation approach - cross-site multiple imputation - designed to impute missing values using linear predictors and their related covariance matrix from imputation models estimated in one or multiple external studies. This allows for the imputation of any missing values without sharing individual data between studies. The idea was previously discussed [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00949655.2024.2404220). In this short tutorial on cross-site imputation, we will work with the newly developed Stata code `mi impute from` that facilitates the imputation of missing values. 

### Download `mi impute from` :computer:
To impute missing data across study sites, we use the Stata package `mi impute from`. The command can be downloaded from the SSC Archive in Stata:

```ruby
ssc install mi_impute_from
```
> [!NOTE]
> In this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02982v1), we describe the underlying method and present the syntax of `mi impute from` alongside practical examples of missing data in collaborative research projects.

# Cross-site imputation 

## How does it work? :pencil2:

For simplicity, we consider three binary variables: an outcome, Y, and exposure, X, and a confounder C. The relations between the three variables is as follows:

> [!TIP]
> To generate the data according to the outlined mechanism above and NOT use any real data, apply the DGM program below.

<details>
**Data Generating Mechanism (DGM)**

To run the code with the simulated data in this example, please check the DGM. 

  ```ruby

cap program drop singlestudy
program define singlestudy, rclass

	syntax /// 
		[, nobs(real 1000) ///
		study(real 1) ///
		filename(string)]
	
	drop _all 
	local nobs = runiformint(500,10000)
	qui set obs `nobs'
	
	local pc =  runiform(0.1, 0.4)
	gen c = rbinomial(1, `pc')
	
		
	local a0 = runiform(0.05, 0.1)
	local a1 = rnormal(ln(4), 0.1)	
	gen x = rbinomial(1, invlogit(`a0'+`a1'*c))

	local b0 = runiform(logit(0.05), logit(0.3))
	local b1 = rnormal(ln(1.5), 0.1)
	local b2 = rnormal(ln(4), 0.1)
	gen y = rbinomial(1, invlogit(`b0'+`b1'*x+`b2'*c))
	
	gen study = `study'
	if "`filename'" != "" qui save "`filename'", replace 
end

```

We generate five studies according to the specified mechanism above: 

```ruby

forv i = 1/5 {
	singlestudy, study(`i') filename(study_`i')
}

```

</details>

### Control approach: No missing data :passport_control:

This analysis serves as a control approach to evaluate the performance of the imputation approach. Can we successfully recover (i.e., impute) missing covariates in a single example? 
In the following examples, we work with `frames` in Stata. Even though we generate all data ourselves, we cannot pool the individual data to make the example as realistic as possible. 
We can initiate the dataframe for our analysis in Stata as follows:

```ruby

capture frame drop metadata
frame create metadata 
qui frame metadata:{ 
	set obs 5 // number of studies
	gen effect = .
	gen se = .
	gen study = .
	gen size = .
}  

```

Now, for each study in our data network, we perform the same analysis (federated analysis) and save the estimates for each study in the frame we initiated in the previous step.

```ruby

forv i = 1/5{
	use study_`i', replace
	logit y x c
	local obs = _N
	frame metadata:{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
		replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
		replace size = `obs'  if _n == `i'
	}
}

```

Finally, the estimates can be meta-analysed with a fixed or random meta-analytical model.

```ruby

frame metadata: list 
frame metadata: meta set effect se , studysize(size)
frame metadata: meta summarize,  eform fixed

```

#### Generate missing data to apply `mi impute from` :heavy_exclamation_mark:

After having conducted the control analysis, we can generate systematically missing data on the confounder C in Study 4 and 5. 

```ruby

forv i = 4/5{
	qui use study_`i', clear 
	qui count 
	di in red "Study `i': N = " r(N)
	replace c = . 
	save study_`i', replace
}

```

### Approach :one: Federated analysis using 5 studies without adjustment for C

In this analysis, we consider all studies, however, none of them includes the adjustment for the confounder C.

```ruby

forv i = 1/5{
	use study_`i', replace
	logit y x
	local obs = _N
	frame metadata:{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
		replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
		replace size = `obs'  if _n == `i'
	}
}

frame metadata: list 
frame metadata: meta set effect se , studysize(size)
frame metadata: meta summarize,  eform fixed

```
### Approach :two: Federated analysis using only studies with complete information on all variables

This approach takes into consideration 3/5 studies and disregards study 4 and 5 as a result of systematically missing data on C at these sites.

```ruby

capture frame drop metadata
frame create metadata 
qui frame metadata:{ 
	set obs 3
	gen effect = .
	gen se = .
	gen study = .
	gen size = .
}  

forv i = 1/3{
	use study_`i', replace
	logit y x c
	local obs = _N
	frame metadata:{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
		replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
		replace size = `obs'  if _n == `i'
	}

}

frame metadata: meta set effect se , studysize(size)
frame metadata: meta summarize,  eform fixed

```

### Approach :three: Federated analysis using all studies with complete and incomplete information on all variables

In this approach we aim to include all studies in the analysis, regardless of whether or not we are able to adjust for C in some of the studies with missing information. 
First, we fit the fully adjusted outcome model in study 1 to 3: 

```ruby

capture frame drop metadata
frame create metadata 
qui frame metadata:{ 
	set obs 5
	gen effect = .
	gen se = .
	gen study = .
	gen size = .
}  

forv i = 1/3{
	use study_`i', replace
	logit y x c
	local obs = _N
	frame metadata: replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
	frame metadata: replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
	frame metadata: replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
	frame metadata: replace size = `obs'  if _n == `i'
}

```

Second, we fit the model not adjusting for the confounding variable C in study 4 and 5. 

```ruby

forv i = 4/5{
	use study_`i', replace
	logit y x
	local obs = _N
		frame metadata:{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
		replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
		replace size = `obs' if _n == `i'
	}
}

```

Finally, we can again analyse all studies with a meta-analytical model.

```ruby

frame metadata: meta set effect se , studysize(size)
frame metadata: meta summarize, eform fixed

```

### Approach :four: Federated analysis using all studies and recovering the missing variable C.

The next two approaches consider all studies and applying cross-site imputation to recover the variables with missing information at sites where values are missing. In this approach, we consider a randomly selected study that has complete information on C (one out of the three studies) and fir the imputation model in that study. The imputation regression coefficients are then exported to text files that can be easily shared with other studies.

```ruby

local pick = runiformint(1,3) 
use study_`pick', clear
	logit c y x
 
	// export matrices 
	mat ib = e(b)
	mat iV = e(V)
	svmat ib
	qui export delimited ib* using b_study`pick'.txt in 1 , replace 
	svmat iV 
	qui export delimited iV* using v_study`pick'.txt if iV1 != . , replace 

```

At the study sites with missing data (Study 4 and Study 5), we import the regression coefficients and impute the missing values on C 10-times. A detailed explanation on this step can be found [here](https://github.com/robertthiesmeier/mi_impute_from.git). Finally, we fit the outcome model to each imputed dataset and combine the estimates with Rubin's rules.

```ruby

forv i = 4/5 {

	use study_`i', clear 
	mi set wide
	mi register imputed c
	
	mi_impute_from_get, b(b_study`pick') v(v_study`pick') colnames(y x _cons) imodel(logit) 
	mat ib = r(get_ib)
	mat iV = r(get_iV)
	
	mi impute from c , add(10) b(ib) v(iV) imodel(logit)

	mi estimate, post noi: logit y x c

	local obs = _N
	frame metadata:{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
		replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
		replace size = `obs'  if _n == `i'
	}
}

```

We have now estimated the C-adjusted effect of the exposure X on the outcome Y after imputing C in Study 4 and 5. Next, we can derive the estimates for Study 1 to 3 as we have done the in the previous steps and apply a meta-analysis to derive a single pooled estimate.

```ruby

forv i = 1/3{
	use study_`i', replace
	logit y x c
	local obs = _N
	frame metadata{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
		replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
		replace size = `obs'  if _n == `i'
	}
}

frame metadata: meta set effect se , studysize(size)
frame metadata: meta summarize, eform fixed

```

### Approach :five: Federated analysis using all studies and recovering the missing variable C.

In this approach, we also consider all five studies using cross-site imputation to recover missing values of C in Study 4 and 5. However, here we consider Study 1 to 3 to fit an imputaton model as opposed to only considering a single study as the basis for imputation. To do so, we first fit the imputation model in the studies with available data on the confounder C. After the first step (fitting the prediction model in the studies with available data), we save all files and transport them to the sites with missing data. Here, we proceed as outlined in Approach 4. The command `mi_impute_from_get` recognises multiple input files and takes a weighted average. 


```ruby

forv i = 1/3 {
	qui use study_`i', replace
	qui logit c y x
	mat ib = e(b)
	mat iV = e(V)
	svmat ib
	qui export delimited ib* using b_study`i'.txt in 1 , replace 
	svmat iV 
	qui export delimited iV* using v_study`i'.txt if iV1 != . , replace 
}

local b_file "b_study1 b_study2 b_study3"
local v_file "v_study1 v_study2 v_study3"

// use the list of files in mi_impute_from_get

forv k = 4/5{
	
	// impute in study 4 & 5 
	use study_`k', clear 
		
	mi set wide
	mi register imputed c
		
	mat drop _all
	mi_impute_from_get, b(`b_file') v(`v_file') colnames(y x _cons) imodel(logit) // weighted average is automatically taken
	mat ib = r(get_ib)
	mat iV = r(get_iV)
	
	mi impute from c , b(ib) v(iV) add(10) imodel(logit)
	mi estimate, post noi: logit y x c

	local obs = _N
	frame metadata:{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `k'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `k'
		replace study = `k' if _n == `k'
		replace size = `obs' if _n == `k'
	}
}

```

We add the estimates for the studies with complete data and apply a meta-analysis in the end. 

```ruby

forv i = 1/3{
	use study_`i', replace
	logit y x c
	local obs = _N
	frame metadata{
		replace effect = _b[x] if _n == `i'
		replace se = _se[x] if _n == `i'
		replace study = `i' if _n == `i'
		replace size = `obs'  if _n == `i'
	}
}

frame metadata: meta set effect se , studysize(size)
frame metadata: meta summarize,  eform fixed

```
